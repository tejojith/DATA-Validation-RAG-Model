Here are some potential MySQL validation queries to ensure that the transformation logic has been applied correctly and completely, data in `target_database` tables was derived as expected from `source_database` tables, all column-level expressions (calculations, mappings, case logic) are correctly computed, JOINs used in the transformation are valid and maintain referential integrity, filters or WHERE clauses are correctly applied, aggregations or GROUP BYs match target values, and no extra or missing rows exist in `target_database`:

1. Row Count Check:
```sql
-- Verify that all tables have the expected number of rows
SELECT COUNT(*) AS row_count FROM source_database.table1;
SELECT COUNT(*) AS row_count FROM target_database.table1;
```
2. Foreign Key Validation:
```sql
-- Verify that foreign key references are intact
SELECT COUNT(*) AS fk_count FROM information_schema.referential_constraints WHERE constraint_schema = 'target_database' AND referenced_table_name IS NOT NULL;
```
3. Data Type Check:
```sql
-- Verify that data types match between source and target tables
SELECT column_name, data_type, character_maximum_length FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_schema = 'source_database' AND table_name = 'table1';
SELECT column_name, data_type, character_maximum_length FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_schema = 'target_database' AND table_name = 'table1';
```
4. Nullability Check:
```sql
-- Verify that nullability matches between source and target tables
SELECT column_name, is_nullable FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_schema = 'source_database' AND table_name = 'table1';
SELECT column_name, is_nullable FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_schema = 'target_database' AND table_name = 'table1';
```
5. Join Validation:
```sql
-- Verify that JOINs used in the transformation are valid and maintain referential integrity
SELECT COUNT(*) AS join_count FROM source_database.table1 INNER JOIN target_database.table2 ON source_database.table1.column1 = target_database.table2.column2;
```
6. Filter Validation:
```sql
-- Verify that filters or WHERE clauses are correctly applied
SELECT COUNT(*) AS filter_count FROM source_database.table1 WHERE column1 > 0;
```
7. Aggregation Validation:
```sql
-- Verify that aggregations or GROUP BYs match target values
SELECT COUNT(*) AS agg_count, SUM(column1) AS sum_column1 FROM source_database.table1 GROUP BY column2;
SELECT COUNT(*) AS agg_count, SUM(column1) AS sum_column1 FROM target_database.table1 WHERE column2 = 'value';
```
8. Extra/Missing Row Validation:
```sql
-- Verify that no extra or missing rows exist in the target table
SELECT COUNT(*) AS row_count FROM source_database.table1;
SELECT COUNT(*) AS row_count FROM target_database.table1;
```
These are just some potential validation queries, and you may need to adjust them based on your specific use case and requirements. Additionally, you can also use other tools such as `diff` or `meld` to compare the data in the source and target tables and identify any discrepancies.
