To validate that all rows from the `raw_orders` table are correctly transformed into the `sales_orders` table, we can use a combination of SELECT statements and JOIN operations to check for missing or mismatched rows, key field value checks, LEFT JOINs for foreign key validation, null-safe value comparisons using COALESCE, joins used in the transformation logic, and any transformation steps such as price calculations or category mappings.

Here are some examples of MySQL queries that can be used to validate the data:

1. Row-level integrity checks:
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM source_database.raw_orders WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM target_database.sales_orders WHERE source_database.raw_orders.order_id = target_database.sales_orders.order_id);
```
This query will check for any rows in the `source_database.raw_orders` table that do not have a corresponding row in the `target_database.sales_orders` table. If there are any missing rows, this query will return a non-zero value.

2. Key field value checks:
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM source_database.raw_orders WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM target_database.sales_orders WHERE source_database.raw_orders.order_id = target_database.sales_orders.order_id AND source_database.raw_orders.customer_id = target_database.sales_orders.customer_id);
```
This query will check for any rows in the `source_database.raw_orders` table that do not have a corresponding row in the `target_database.sales_orders` table with the same `order_id` and `customer_id`. If there are any missing or mismatched rows, this query will return a non-zero value.

3. LEFT JOIN checks for foreign key validation:
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM source_database.raw_orders AS so
LEFT JOIN target_database.sales_orders AS so2 ON so.order_id = so2.order_id AND so.customer_id = so2.customer_id
WHERE so2.order_id IS NULL;
```
This query will check for any rows in the `source_database.raw_orders` table that do not have a corresponding row in the `target_database.sales_orders` table with the same `order_id` and `customer_id`. If there are any missing or mismatched rows, this query will return a non-zero value.

4. Null-safe value comparisons using COALESCE:
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM source_database.raw_orders AS so
LEFT JOIN target_database.sales_orders AS so2 ON so.order_id = so2.order_id AND so.customer_id = so2.customer_id
WHERE COALESCE(so.total_amount, 0) <> COALESCE(so2.total_amount, 0);
```
This query will check for any rows in the `source_database.raw_orders` table where the `total_amount` field is not equal to the corresponding value in the `target_database.sales_orders` table. If there are any discrepancies in the values, this query will return a non-zero value.

5. Joins used in transformation logic:
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM source_database.raw_orders AS so
JOIN target_database.sales_orders AS so2 ON so.order_id = so2.order_id AND so.customer_id = so2.customer_id
WHERE so.status <> so2.status;
```
This query will check for any rows in the `source_database.raw_orders` table where the `status` field is not equal to the corresponding value in the `target_database.sales_orders` table. If there are any discrepancies in the values, this query will return a non-zero value.

6. Any transformation steps:
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM source_database.raw_orders AS so
JOIN target_database.sales_orders AS so2 ON so.order_id = so2.order_id AND so.customer_id = so2.customer_id
WHERE so.price <> so2.price;
```
This query will check for any rows in the `source_database.raw_orders` table where the `price` field is not equal to the corresponding value in the `target_database.sales_orders` table. If there are any discrepancies in the values
