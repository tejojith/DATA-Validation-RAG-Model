 To validate the data in the `employees` table, you can create a series of tests to check for data type conformity, value ranges, business rule compliance, and referential integrity. Here's an example Python script using the `pandas` library to perform these tests:

```python
import pandas as pd
from datetime import datetime

# Load the employees table into a DataFrame
df = pd.read_sql_query("SELECT * FROM employees", connection)

def test_data_type_conformity():
    for col in df.columns:
        if df[col].dtype != int and df[col].dtype != float and df[col].dtype != str:
            print(f"Error: Column {col} has an incorrect data type.")

def test_value_ranges():
    # Define the expected value ranges for each column
    min_salary = 40000
    max_salary = 100000

    if df['salary'].min() < min_salary or df['salary'].max() > max_salary:
        print("Error: Salary values are outside the expected range.")

def test_business_rule_compliance():
    # Define a business rule that checks if employees in the 'Marketing' department have a salary greater than or equal to 60000
    marketing_salaries = df[df['department'] == 'Marketing']['salary'].values

    if any(salary < 60000 for salary in marketing_salaries):
        print("Error: Marketing employees have a salary less than the expected minimum.")

def test_referential_integrity():
    # Check that no employee has a null value in the 'id' column
    if df['id'].isnull().any():
        print("Error: Employee(s) have a null id.")

# Run the tests
test_data_type_conformity()
test_value_ranges()
test_business_rule_compliance()
test_referential_integrity()
```

This script will print an error message if any of the tests fail. You can run this script periodically to ensure data accuracy in your `employees` table.
