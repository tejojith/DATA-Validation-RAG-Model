Here are some potential MySQL validation queries to ensure that the transformation logic has been applied correctly and completely, data in `target_database` tables was derived as expected from `source_database` tables, all column-level expressions (calculations, mappings, case logic) are correctly computed, JOINs used in the transformation are valid and maintain referential integrity, filters or WHERE clauses are correctly applied, aggregations or GROUP BYs match target values, no extra or missing rows exist in `target_database`, and foreign key references are intact:

1. Row Count Check:
```sql
-- Verify that the number of rows in each table is as expected
SELECT COUNT(*) AS source_count FROM source_database.table1;
SELECT COUNT(*) AS target_count FROM target_database.table1;
```
2. Foreign Key Validation:
```sql
-- Verify that foreign key references are intact
SELECT * FROM target_database.table1 WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM source_database.table2 WHERE source_database.table1.fk = source_database.table2.pk);
```
3. Join Validation:
```sql
-- Verify that JOINs used in the transformation are valid and maintain referential integrity
SELECT * FROM target_database.table1 LEFT JOIN source_database.table2 ON target_database.table1.fk = source_database.table2.pk;
```
4. Filter Validation:
```sql
-- Verify that filters or WHERE clauses are correctly applied
SELECT * FROM target_database.table1 WHERE column1 > 0 AND column2 < 10;
```
5. Aggregation Validation:
```sql
-- Verify that aggregations or GROUP BYs match target values
SELECT COUNT(*) AS count, SUM(column1) AS sum, AVG(column2) AS avg FROM target_database.table1 GROUP BY column3;
```
6. Missing/Extra Row Validation:
```sql
-- Verify that no extra or missing rows exist in `target_database`
SELECT COUNT(*) AS count FROM target_database.table1 WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM source_database.table2 WHERE source_database.table1.fk = source_database.table2.pk);
```
7. Data Validation:
```sql
-- Verify that data in `target_database` tables was derived as expected from `source_database` tables
SELECT * FROM target_database.table1 WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM source_database.table2 WHERE source_database.table1.fk = source_database.table2.pk);
```
8. Column-Level Expression Validation:
```sql
-- Verify that column-level expressions (calculations, mappings, case logic) are correctly computed
SELECT * FROM target_database.table1 WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM source_database.table2 WHERE source_database.table1.fk = source_database.table2.pk);
```
These validation queries can be used to ensure that the transformation logic has been applied correctly and completely, data in `target_database` tables was derived as expected from `source_database` tables, all column-level expressions (calculations, mappings, case logic) are correctly computed, JOINs used in the transformation are valid and maintain referential integrity, filters or WHERE clauses are correctly applied, aggregations or GROUP BYs match target values, no extra or missing rows exist in `target_database`, and foreign key references are intact.
