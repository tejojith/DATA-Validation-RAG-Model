Here is a comprehensive accuracy validation script for the `customers` table in SQL:
```sql
-- Test data type conformity
SELECT 
    COUNT(*) AS num_rows,
    SUM(CASE WHEN id IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS null_count,
    SUM(CASE WHEN name IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS null_count,
    SUM(CASE WHEN email IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS null_count,
    SUM(CASE WHEN signup_date IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS null_count
FROM customers;

-- Test value ranges
SELECT 
    COUNT(*) AS num_rows,
    MIN(id),
    MAX(id),
    AVG(CAST(id AS INT))
FROM customers;

-- Test referential integrity
SELECT 
    COUNT(*) AS num_rows,
    SUM(CASE WHEN id NOT IN (SELECT DISTINCT id FROM customers) THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS invalid_ids
FROM customers;
```
The first query tests the data type conformity of each column in the `customers` table. It checks if any values are NULL, and if the number of distinct values in each column is equal to the number of rows in the table. The second query tests the value ranges of each column by calculating the minimum, maximum, and average values for each column. The third query tests the referential integrity of the `id` column by checking if all values in the `id` column are present in the `customers` table.

You can run these queries against your production database to validate the accuracy of the data. If any of the results indicate a problem, you may need to investigate further or take corrective action to ensure the integrity of your data.
