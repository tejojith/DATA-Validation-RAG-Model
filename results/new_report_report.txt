 To validate the data in your `source_db` table named `employees`, you can create a series of SQL queries to check for data type conformity, value ranges, business rule compliance, and referential integrity. Here's an example script that covers these aspects:

```sql
-- Data Type Conformity
SELECT id, name, department, salary, hired_date
FROM employees
WHERE
    (id NOT IN (SELECT DISTINCT id FROM employees)) OR
    (name NOT LIKE '%[^a-zA-Z0-9\s]%') OR
    (department NOT LIKE '%[^a-zA-Z0-9\s]%') OR
    (salary NOT REGEXP '^-?[0-9]+(\.[0-9]{1,2})?$') OR
    (hired_date IS NULL) OR
    (hired_date NOT DATE);

-- Value Ranges
SELECT id, name, department, salary, hired_date
FROM employees
WHERE
    (salary < 0) OR
    (salary > 999999.99);

-- Business Rule Compliance
-- Assuming there's a minimum salary requirement of 45000 and a maximum of 100000 for the employees table
SELECT id, name, department, salary, hired_date
FROM employees
WHERE
    (salary < 45000) OR
    (salary > 100000);

-- Referential Integrity
-- Assuming there are no foreign keys in the provided table schema, you can skip this test for now.
```

This script will help you identify any inconsistencies or errors in your data based on the given conditions. You may need to adjust these queries according to your specific business rules and requirements.
