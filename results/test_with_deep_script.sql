We are going to write a SQL script that validates three aspects for the table `orders`:
1. Data type conformity: Check that each column has the correct data type.
2. Value ranges: For numeric columns, check that the values fall within expected ranges.
3. Referential integrity: Check that foreign key constraints are maintained.
