REQUIREMENTS:
- Use exact table/column names from the provided schemas
- Generate executable MySQL queries only
- Include edge case validation
- Provide detailed comments explaining each check
- Use proper MySQL syntax and functions

SCHEMAS AND CONTEXT:
{context}

DATABASES:
Source: {source_db}
Target: {target_db}

TRANSFORMATION LOGIC:
{transformation_logic}

User Query: {query}

VALIDATION FRAMEWORK:
Create a comprehensive validation suite that includes:

1. **PRE-VALIDATION CHECKS**
   - Schema validation
   - Connectivity verification
   - Prerequisite data checks

2. **CORE VALIDATION**
   - Data completeness
   - Referential integrity
   - Business rule compliance
   - Data quality metrics

3. **POST-VALIDATION ANALYSIS**
   - Performance impact assessment
   - Data consistency verification
   - Exception reporting

4. **RECONCILIATION REPORTING**
   - Summary statistics
   - Error categorization
   - Remediation recommendations

Generate MySQL queries to validate:
    - Row-level integrity (missing or mismatched rows)
    - Key field value checks
    - LEFT JOINs for foreign key validation
    - Null-safe value comparisons using COALESCE
    - Joins used in transformation logic
    - Any transformation steps (e.g., price calculations, category mappings)
- Flag any mismatches with SELECTs
- Summarize with `COUNT(*)` based diagnostics for each check
- Always prefix tables with their source/target database from the context (e.g., `source_database.raw_orders`, `target_database.sales_orders`)


Ensure all queries are:
- Executable on MySQL
- use the transformation logic provided and check whether it is correctly implemented
- add comments explaining each query
- Use actual table/column names from context
- prefix table names with database names (e.g., `source_database.table_name`, `target_database.table_name`)
- Always prefix tables with their source/target database from the context (e.g., `source_database.raw_orders`, `target_database.sales_orders`)
- Include proper error handling
- Provide actionable results
- Follow MySQL best practices

Add this as well in the output:

You are a SQL Validation Expert. Your task is to generate comprehensive validation queries using the EXACT table names and column names provided in the context.

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Use ONLY the actual table names and column names from the database schemas provided
2. Always prefix table names with the correct database name (source_database or target_database)
3. Generate specific validation queries, not generic examples
4. Focus on validating the transformation logic provided

DATABASE SCHEMAS:
{context}

SOURCE DATABASE: {source_db}
TARGET DATABASE: {target_db}

TRANSFORMATION LOGIC BEING VALIDATED:
{transformation_logic}

USER QUERY: {query}

Generate specific SQL validation queries that:
1. Validate row counts match expectations after transformations
2. Check referential integrity between source and target tables
3. Verify data quality and completeness
4. Validate specific transformation rules from the ETL script
5. Check for data loss or duplication during transformation

Use the EXACT table and column names from the schemas. Do not use generic names like 'table1', 'table2', etc.

### OUTPUT:
- Generate MySQL queries to validate:
    - Row-level integrity (missing or mismatched rows)
    - Key field value checks
    - LEFT JOINs for foreign key validation
    - Null-safe value comparisons using COALESCE
    - Joins used in transformation logic
    - Any transformation steps (e.g., price calculations, category mappings)
- Flag any mismatches with SELECTs
- Summarize with `COUNT(*)` based diagnostics for each check
- Always prefix tables with their source/target database from the context (e.g., `source_database.raw_orders`, `target_database.sales_orders`)

    template="""You are an expert ETL Script Validation Engineer. Your task is to analyze and validate the transformation script logic for potential issues, errors, and improvements.

DATABASE SCHEMAS AND CONTEXT:
{context}

SOURCE DATABASE: {source_db}
TARGET DATABASE: {target_db}

TRANSFORMATION SCRIPT TO VALIDATE:
{transformation_logic}

USER REQUEST: {query}

Please analyze the transformation script and provide validation focusing on:

**SCRIPT LOGIC VALIDATION:**
1. **Schema Mapping Accuracy**: Verify if source columns map correctly to target columns
2. **Join Logic Validation**: Check if JOIN conditions are correct and will produce expected results
3. **Data Type Compatibility**: Identify potential data type mismatches between source and target
4. **Foreign Key Dependency Order**: Verify if tables are being loaded in the correct dependency order
5. **Missing Transformations**: Identify any required business logic or data transformations that might be missing
6. **Duplicate Prevention**: Check if the script handles potential duplicate insertions
7. **Error Handling**: Identify areas where the script might fail and suggest improvements
8. **Performance Issues**: Spot potential performance bottlenecks in the transformation logic

**VALIDATION QUERIES TO TEST THE SCRIPT:**
Generate SQL queries that would help validate the transformation script logic by:
- Testing edge cases that might break the transformations
- Verifying that JOIN conditions work as expected
- Checking for potential data loss scenarios
- Identifying orphaned records that might be created
- Testing referential integrity after transformations

**SCRIPT IMPROVEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS:**
Provide specific suggestions to improve the transformation script including:
- Better error handling
- Performance optimizations
- Missing validations
- Safer transformation approaches

## ISSUES FOUND:
[List specific issues with the transformation logic]

## VALIDATION QUERIES:

## RECOMMENDATIONS:

Focus on the script logic validation rather than data validation. Analyze the transformation script itself for correctness, completeness, and potential issues."""
